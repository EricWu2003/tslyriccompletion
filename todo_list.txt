Program changes to make:
fix the AFM logic
fix logic for picking lines. If a line is repeated multiple times,
    it shouldn't be picked much too often.
    Maybe pick it with a probability proportional to log(n) if the line appears n times.
check the "show prev line" logic, and confirm it works for lines that appear multiple times
    specifically, if a player has seen the previous lines, should the player still be able to have the flexibility of answering either part of the song if there are multiple successors?
