Lover
Afterglow
[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?$<mult_succ>
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant$<mult_succ>
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?$<mult_succ>
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant$<mult_succ>
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say$<mult_succ>
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant$<mult_succ>
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow$<bad_succ>
