Lover
I Think He Knows
[Verse 1]
I think he knows$<mult_succ>
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows$<mult_succ>
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine
[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans$<mult_succ>
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands
[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue$<mult_succ>
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul$<mult_succ>
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows$<mult_succ>
I think he knows$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows$<mult_succ>
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)
[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans$<mult_succ>
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand
[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)$<mult_succ>
Skipping down 16th Avenue$<mult_succ>
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)$<mult_succ>
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul$<mult_succ>
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows$<mult_succ>
[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my$<mult_succ>
I want you, bless my$<mult_succ>
I want you, bless my$<mult_succ>
I want you, bless my soul$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive$<mult_succ>
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive$<mult_succ>
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)$<mult_succ>
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)$<mult_succ>
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul$<mult_succ>
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows$<mult_succ>
[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my$<mult_succ>
I want you, bless my$<mult_succ>
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my$<mult_succ>
I want you, bless my soul$<mult_succ>
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows$<bad_succ>
