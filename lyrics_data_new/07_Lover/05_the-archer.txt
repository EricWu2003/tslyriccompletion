Lover
The Archer
[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey$<mult_succ>
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey$<mult_succ>
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?$<mult_succ>
(I see right through me, I see right through me)$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me$<mult_succ>
They see right through$<mult_succ>
Can you see right through me?
They see right through$<mult_succ>
They see right through me$<mult_succ>
I see right through me$<mult_succ>
I see right through me$<mult_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey$<mult_succ>
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?$<mult_succ>
(I see right through me, I see right through me)$<mult_succ>
Who could stay?$<mult_succ>
Who could stay?$<mult_succ>
Who could stay?$<mult_succ>
You could stay$<mult_succ>
You could stay$<mult_succ>
[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat$<bad_succ>
