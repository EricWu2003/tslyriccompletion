Wildest Dreams
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well$<mult_succ>
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me$<mult_succ>
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again$<mult_succ>
Even if it's just in your$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Wildest dreams, ah, ha$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
Wildest dreams, ah, ha$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now
[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well$<mult_succ>
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me$<mult_succ>
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again$<mult_succ>
Even if it's just in your$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)$<exclamatory><bad_succ>
Wildest dreams, ah, ha$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night$<mult_succ>
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories$<mult_succ>
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night$<mult_succ>
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories$<mult_succ>
Follow (Follow) you (You) around
(Follow you around)
[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me$<mult_succ>
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again$<mult_succ>
Even if it's just pretend
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me$<mult_succ>
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again$<mult_succ>
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)$<bad_succ>
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)$<exclamatory>
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha$<mult_succ>
Even if it's just in your$<mult_succ>
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha$<mult_succ>
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha$<bad_succ>
