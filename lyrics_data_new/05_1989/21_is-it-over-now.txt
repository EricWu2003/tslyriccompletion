Is It Over Now?
[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)$<bad_succ>
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)$<exclamatory>
You still wouldn't go
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later$<mult_succ>
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor$<mult_succ>
You search in every maiden's bed for something greater, baby
[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then?
And is it over now?$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
When you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone
[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs$<mult_succ>
Oh Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings$<mult_succ>
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no$<mult_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor$<mult_succ>
You search in every model's bed for something greater, baby
[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then?
And is it over now?$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs$<mult_succ>
Oh, Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings$<mult_succ>
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no$<mult_succ>
[Outro]
Flashing lights, oh, Lord
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later$<mult_succ>
I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing
I've been wanting, but no$<bad_succ>
