Say Don't Go
[Verse 1]
I've known it from the very start
We're a shot in the darkest dark$<bad_succ>
Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed$<exclamatory>
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness$<bad_succ>
Oh no, oh no, it won't stop$<exclamatory>
[Refrain]
I'm standing on a tightrope alone
I hold my breath a little bit longer
Halfway out the door, but it won't close
I'm holding out hope for you to
[Pre-Chorus]
Say, "Don't go"
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleedin', bleedin'?$<mult_succ>
Why'd you whisper in the dark?
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screamin', screamin'
[Post-Chorus]
(Say) Say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"
I would stay forever if you (Say) say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"$<mult_succ>
(Say, say, say, say)$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Now I'm pacing on shaky ground
Strike a match, then you blow it out$<bad_succ>
Oh no, oh no, it's not fair$<exclamatory>
'Cause you kiss me and it stops time
And I'm yours, but you're not mine$<bad_succ>
Oh no, oh no, you're not there$<exclamatory>
[Refrain]
I'm standing on the sidewalk alone
I wait for you to drive by
I'm tryna see the cards that you won't show
I'm about to fold unless you
[Pre-Chorus]
(Say) Say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"
I would stay forever if you (Say) say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleedin', bleedin'?$<mult_succ>
Why'd you whisper in the dark?
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screamin', screamin'
[Post-Chorus]
(Say) Say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"
I would stay forever if you (Say) say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"$<mult_succ>
(Say, say, say, say)$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to)$<mult_succ>
Make me want you (Make me want you)?
Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to)$<mult_succ>
Give me nothin' back?
Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to)$<mult_succ>
Make me love you (Make me love you)?
I said, "I love you" (I said, "I love you")
You say nothin' back
[Chorus]
Why'd you have to lead me on? (Oh)
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleedin', bleedin'?$<mult_succ>
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screamin', screamin'
[Post-Chorus]
(Say) Say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"
I would stay forever if you (Say) say, "(Don't) don't (Go) go"$<mult_succ>
(Say, say, say, say)$<mult_succ>
[Outro]
But you won't, but you won't, but you won't
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"$<mult_succ>
But you won't, but you won't, but you won't$<bad_succ>
