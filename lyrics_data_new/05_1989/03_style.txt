Style
[Verse 1]
Midnight$<exclamatory>
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like$<mult_succ>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time$<mult_succ>
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style$<mult_succ>
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt$<mult_succ>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time$<mult_succ>
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)$<bad_succ>
I say, "I heard, oh$<exclamatory>
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"
[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like$<mult_succ>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time$<mult_succ>
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style$<mult_succ>
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt$<mult_succ>
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time$<mult_succ>
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style
[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home$<bad_succ>
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh$<exclamatory>
(Out of style)
[Chorus]
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like$<mult_succ>
And when we go crashing down (And when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style$<bad_succ>
