cardigan
[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing$<mult_succ>
Sequin smile, black lipstick$<bad_succ>
Sensual politics$<exclamatory>
When you are young, they assume you know nothing$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
But I knew you$<mult_succ>
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you$<mult_succ>
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
But I knew you$<mult_succ>
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you$<mult_succ>
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I
[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you$<mult_succ>
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you$<mult_succ>
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite$<bad_succ>
