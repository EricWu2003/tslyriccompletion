[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night$<mult_succ>
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes$<bad_succ>
Uh-uh, uh-uh$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
It feels like a perfect night$<mult_succ>
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers$<bad_succ>
Uh-uh, uh-uh$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' twenty-two$<mult_succ>
Everything will be alright if$<mult_succ>
You keep me next to you$<mult_succ>
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to$<mult_succ>
Everything will be alright if$<mult_succ>
We just keep dancin' like we're$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Twenty-two$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
Twenty-two$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights$<mult_succ>
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights$<mult_succ>
We ditch the whole scene$<mult_succ>
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleepin'$<bad_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Chorus]
(Hey)$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' twenty-two$<mult_succ>
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you$<mult_succ>
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to$<mult_succ>
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancin' like we're$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Twenty-two (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)$<exclamatory>
Twenty-two (I don't know about you)$<bad_succ>
Twenty-two$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
Twenty-two (Ooh)
[Post-Chorus]
It feels like one of those nights$<mult_succ>
We ditch the whole scene$<mult_succ>
It feels like one of those nights$<mult_succ>
We won't be sleepin'$<mult_succ>
It feels like one of those nights$<mult_succ>
You look like bad news
I gotta have you$<mult_succ>
