evermore
willow
[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind$<mult_succ>
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man$<mult_succ>
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind$<mult_succ>
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind$<mult_succ>
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man$<mult_succ>
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man$<mult_succ>
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man$<mult_succ>
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man$<mult_succ>
[Outro]
Hey, that's my man$<mult_succ>
That's my man$<mult_succ>
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art$<mult_succ>
That's my man$<mult_succ>
Hey, that's my man$<mult_succ>
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man$<bad_succ>
