Speak Now
Haunted
[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time$<mult_succ>
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake$<bad_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, holding my breath$<exclamatory>
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out$<mult_succ>
Something's gone terribly wrong$<mult_succ>
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out$<mult_succ>
Can't breathe whenever you're gone$<mult_succ>
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead$<bad_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath$<exclamatory>
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out$<mult_succ>
Something's gone terribly wrong$<mult_succ>
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out$<mult_succ>
Can't breathe whenever you're gone$<mult_succ>
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Bridge]
I know$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
I know$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out$<mult_succ>
Something's gone terribly wrong$<mult_succ>
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out$<mult_succ>
Can't breathe whenever you're gone$<mult_succ>
Can't go back, I'm haunted$<bad_succ>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)$<exclamatory>
[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time$<mult_succ>
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it$<bad_succ>
