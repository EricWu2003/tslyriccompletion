Midnights
Sweet Nothing
[Verse 1]
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly, a pebble
That we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?$<bad_succ>
Ooh, ooh$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Chorus]
They said the end is coming$<mult_succ>
Everyone's up to something$<mult_succ>
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving$<mult_succ>
You're in the kitchen humming$<mult_succ>
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time$<bad_succ>
Ooh, ooh$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Chorus]
'Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something$<mult_succ>
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving$<mult_succ>
You're in the kitchen humming$<mult_succ>
All that you ever wanted from me was nothing
[Bridge]
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
To you, I can't admit that I'm just too soft for all of it$<bad_succ>
Ooh$<exclamatory>
[Chorus]
They said the end is coming$<mult_succ>
Everyone's up to something$<mult_succ>
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving$<mult_succ>
You're in the kitchen humming$<mult_succ>
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing$<mult_succ>
They said the end is coming$<mult_succ>
(They said the end is coming)
Everyone's up to something$<mult_succ>
(Everyone's up to something)
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving$<mult_succ>
(Outside they're push and shoving)
You're in the kitchen humming$<mult_succ>
(You're in the kitchen humming)
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing$<bad_succ>
