Midnights
High Infidelity
[Verse 1]
Lock broken, slur spoken
Wound open, game token
I didn't know you were keeping count$<mult_succ>
Rain soaking, blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Chorus]
High infidelity$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
High infidelity$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it$<mult_succ>
[Refrain]
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?$<mult_succ>
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Storm coming, good husband$<bad_succ>
Bad omen$<exclamatory>
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money
I'd pay if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time
[Refrain]
You know there's many different ways
That you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough$<mult_succ>
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?$<mult_succ>
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?$<bad_succ>
[Chorus]
High infidelity$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
High infidelity$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it$<mult_succ>
[Refrain]
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?$<mult_succ>
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?$<mult_succ>
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Chorus]
High infidelity$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
High infidelity$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh$<exclamatory>
Woo, woo, woo$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Woo$<exclamatory><bad_succ>
Ooh, ooh, ohh$<exclamatory>
Woo, woo, woo$<mult_succ>
Yeah, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And it's never enough, it's never enough
[Outro]
Lock broken, slur spoken
Wound open, game token
I didn't know you were keeping count$<mult_succ>
Rain soaking, blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count$<mult_succ>
But oh, you were keeping count$<bad_succ>
