So It Goes
[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us$<mult_succ>
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little$<mult_succ>
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...$<mult_succ>
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I$<mult_succ>
Do bad things with you
So it goes...$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us$<mult_succ>
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little$<mult_succ>
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...$<mult_succ>
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I$<mult_succ>
Do bad things with you
So it goes...$<mult_succ>
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes$<mult_succ>
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?$<mult_succ>
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?$<mult_succ>
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?$<mult_succ>
Who's counting? (One, two, three)
[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place (Pieces fall)
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...$<mult_succ>
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I$<mult_succ>
I do bad things with you
So it goes...$<mult_succ>
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes$<mult_succ>
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes$<mult_succ>
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes$<mult_succ>
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes$<bad_succ>
