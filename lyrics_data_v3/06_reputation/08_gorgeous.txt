Gorgeous
[Intro]
Gorgeous$<exclamatory>
[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment$<mult_succ>
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous$<mult_succ>
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious$<mult_succ>
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment$<mult_succ>
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous$<mult_succ>
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)$<mult_succ>
And I'm so furious$<mult_succ>
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)$<mult_succ>
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)$<mult_succ>
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)$<mult_succ>
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous$<mult_succ>
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)$<mult_succ>
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)$<mult_succ>
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous$<mult_succ>
[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)$<mult_succ>
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)$<mult_succ>
You're gorgeous$<mult_succ>
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous$<bad_succ>
