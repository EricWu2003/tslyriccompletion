New Years Day
[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor$<mult_succ>
You and me from the night before, but
[Chorus]
Don't read the last page$<mult_succ>
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
[Chorus]
Don't read the last page$<mult_succ>
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day$<mult_succ>
[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you$<mult_succ>
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you$<mult_succ>
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you$<mult_succ>
And I will hold on to you
[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger$<mult_succ>
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere$<mult_succ>
Please don't ever become a stranger$<mult_succ>
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere$<mult_succ>
[Verse 3]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor$<mult_succ>
You and me forevermore
[Chorus]
Don't read the last page$<mult_succ>
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day$<mult_succ>
[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you$<mult_succ>
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you$<mult_succ>
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you$<mult_succ>
And I will hold on to you
[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger$<mult_succ>
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere$<mult_succ>
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)$<mult_succ>
Please don't ever become a stranger$<mult_succ>
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)$<mult_succ>
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere$<mult_succ>
(I will hold on to you)$<bad_succ>
