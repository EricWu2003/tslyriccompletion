Fearless
Untouchable
[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name$<mult_succ>
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together$<mult_succ>
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun$<mult_succ>
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name$<mult_succ>
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together$<mult_succ>
Come on, come on, oh$<mult_succ>
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together$<mult_succ>
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
I'm caught up in you$<bad_succ>
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh$<exclamatory>
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun$<mult_succ>
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name$<mult_succ>
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together$<mult_succ>
Come on, come on, oh$<mult_succ>
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name$<mult_succ>
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together$<mult_succ>
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together$<mult_succ>
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh$<exclamatory>
[Outro]
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name$<mult_succ>
You got to come on, come on, oh
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name$<mult_succ>
They're spelling out your name, oh$<bad_succ>
