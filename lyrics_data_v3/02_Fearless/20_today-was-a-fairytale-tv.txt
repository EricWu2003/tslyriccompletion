Fearless
Today Was A Fairytale
[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down$<mult_succ>
Whenever you're around$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
It must have been the way$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down$<mult_succ>
Whenever you're around, yeah
[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
It must have been the way$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
Time slows down$<mult_succ>
Whenever you're around$<mult_succ>
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way$<mult_succ>
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<mult_succ>
It must have been the way$<mult_succ>
Today was a fairytale$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Outro]
Oh, oh, yeah, oh-oh$<exclamatory>
Today was a fairytale$<bad_succ>
