Taylor Swift
Invisible
[Verse 1]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
[Chorus]
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you$<mult_succ>
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me$<mult_succ>
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful$<bad_succ>
Miracle$<exclamatory><bad_succ>
Unbelievable$<exclamatory>
Instead of just invisible$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Oh, yeah$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
[Chorus]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you$<mult_succ>
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me$<mult_succ>
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful$<bad_succ>
Miracle$<exclamatory><bad_succ>
Unbelievable$<exclamatory>
Instead of just invisible$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize
[Chorus]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you$<mult_succ>
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful$<bad_succ>
Miracle$<exclamatory><bad_succ>
Unbelievable$<exclamatory>
Instead of just invisible$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Oh, yeah$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Outro]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile$<bad_succ>
