I Wish You Would
[Verse 1]
It's 2AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
[Chorus 1]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that$<mult_succ>
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
It's 2AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down$<mult_succ>
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around
[Chorus 2]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that$<mult_succ>
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would$<mult_succ>
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that$<mult_succ>
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Post-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Bridge]
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would$<mult_succ>
(I wish you would, I wish you would)$<mult_succ>
I wish you would, I wish you would$<mult_succ>
(I wish you would, I wish you would)$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
(I wish I, wish I)$<exclamatory>
[Verse 3]
2AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down$<mult_succ>
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around
[Chorus 2]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that$<mult_succ>
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would$<mult_succ>
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that$<mult_succ>
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would$<mult_succ>
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that$<mult_succ>
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Outro]
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would$<mult_succ>
(I wish you would, I wish you would)$<mult_succ>
I wish you would, I wish you would$<mult_succ>
(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)$<bad_succ>
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
I wish you would$<bad_succ>
