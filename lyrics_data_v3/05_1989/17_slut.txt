1989
Slut
[Verse 1]
Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimming pool
What if all I need is you?
[Pre-Chorus]
Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you'll never forget$<mult_succ>
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't
[Chorus]
But if I'm all dressed up
They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once$<mult_succ>
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Send the code, he's waiting there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pulling me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman
[Pre-Chorus]
Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)
Love to think you'll never forget$<mult_succ>
We'll pay the price, I guess
[Chorus]
But if I'm all dressed up (If I'm all dressed up)
They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)
You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
Half asleep, taking your time
In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury
You're not saying you're in love with me
But you're going to$<mult_succ>
Half awake, taking your chances
It's a big mistake, I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"
I'm not saying, "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)
But you're going to$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Outro]
(Up)$<exclamatory>
And if they call me a (Slut)
You know it might be worth it for once$<mult_succ>
And if I'm gonna be (Drunk)
I might as well be drunk in love$<bad_succ>
