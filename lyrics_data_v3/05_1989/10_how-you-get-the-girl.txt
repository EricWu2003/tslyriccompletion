How You Get The Girl
[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
Oh, oh, oh$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
Oh-oh, oh-oh$<exclamatory>
[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say
[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better$<mult_succ>
I would wait forever and ever$<mult_succ>
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together$<mult_succ>
I would wait forever and ever$<mult_succ>
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl, girl$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say
[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better$<mult_succ>
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together$<mult_succ>
I would wait forever and ever$<mult_succ>
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl, girl$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Yeah, yeah$<exclamatory>
[Bridge]
And you know$<bad_succ>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh$<exclamatory>
That I don't want you to go, oh, oh
[Breakdown]
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah-yeah
And then you say
[Chorus]
'Cause I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together$<mult_succ>
I would wait forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl, girl (This is how it works)
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl)
(That's how it works)
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl, girl$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
And that's how it works$<mult_succ>
That's how you get the girl, girl$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
[Outro]
That's how it works
That's how you got the girl$<bad_succ>
