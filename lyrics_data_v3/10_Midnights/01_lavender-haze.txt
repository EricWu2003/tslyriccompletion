Midnights
Lavender Haze
[Intro]
Meet me at midnight
[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into$<bad_succ>
My melancholia$<exclamatory><bad_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)$<exclamatory>
You handled it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me$<bad_succ>
Surreal$<exclamatory>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
No deal$<exclamatory>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife$<bad_succ>
[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)$<exclamatory>
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me$<bad_succ>
Surreal$<exclamatory>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
No deal$<exclamatory>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze$<mult_succ>
[Post-Chorus]
That lavender haze
[Bridge]
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest$<mult_succ>
Get it off my desk (Get it off my desk)
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest$<mult_succ>
Get it off my desk$<mult_succ>
[Chorus]
I feel (I feel), the lavender haze creeping up on me$<bad_succ>
Surreal$<exclamatory>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
No deal (No deal)$<exclamatory>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze$<mult_succ>
[Outro]
Get it off your chest$<mult_succ>
Get it off my desk$<mult_succ>
The lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze$<bad_succ>
