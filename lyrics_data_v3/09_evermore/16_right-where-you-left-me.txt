evermore
right where you left me
[Verse 1]
Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me
[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight"$<mult_succ>
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth$<mult_succ>
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair$<mult_succ>
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared
[Chorus]
Right where you left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever$<mult_succ>
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy$<mult_succ>
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy$<mult_succ>
And you're sitting in front of me
[Bridge]
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth$<mult_succ>
Everybody moved on
[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight"$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
I, I stayed there$<exclamatory>
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair$<mult_succ>
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong
[Chorus]
I'm right where
You left me
You left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever$<mult_succ>
You left me
You left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever$<bad_succ>
