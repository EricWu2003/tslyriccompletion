evermore
long story short
[Verse 1]
Fatefully$<exclamatory>
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me$<bad_succ>
Misery$<exclamatory>
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break
[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time$<mult_succ>
Pushed from the precipice$<mult_succ>
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you$<mult_succ>
I'm all about you, ah$<bad_succ>
Yeah, yeah$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
I'm all about you, ah$<bad_succ>
Yeah, yeah$<exclamatory><bad_succ><mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
Actually$<exclamatory>
I always felt I must look better in the rear view$<bad_succ>
Missing me$<exclamatory>
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready
[Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time$<mult_succ>
Pushed from the precipice$<mult_succ>
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you$<mult_succ>
I'm all about you, ah$<bad_succ>
Yeah, yeah$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
I'm all about you$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)$<mult_succ>
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)$<mult_succ>
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore$<bad_succ>
[Verse 3]
Past me$<exclamatory>
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things$<bad_succ>
Your nemeses$<exclamatory>
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time$<mult_succ>
Pushed from the precipice$<mult_succ>
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived
[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you$<mult_succ>
(And now) I'm all about you, ah$<mult_succ>
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
Yeah, yeah$<exclamatory><mult_succ>
I'm all about you$<bad_succ><mult_succ>
(And now) Yeah, yeah$<exclamatory>
I'm all about you$<mult_succ>
[Outro]
Long story short, it was a bad time$<mult_succ>
Long story short, I survived$<bad_succ>
