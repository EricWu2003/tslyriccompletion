Red
Ronan
[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway$<mult_succ>
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
[Chorus]
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here$<mult_succ>
You were my best four years"$<mult_succ>
[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear
[Chorus]
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here$<mult_succ>
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here$<mult_succ>
You were my best four years"$<mult_succ>
[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
[Chorus]
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here$<mult_succ>
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here$<mult_succ>
You were my best four years
[Outro]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway$<mult_succ>
I love you to the moon and back$<bad_succ>
