THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT
I Can Do It With a Broken Heart
[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
"She's having the time of her life
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night"
I can show you lies 

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"
I was grinning like I'm winning
I was hitting my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart$<misc_bad end of post chorus>

[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doing it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"
I was grinning like I'm winning
I was hitting my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart$<misc_bad end of post chorus>

[Outro]
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart$<misc_bad outro>
You know you're good, and I'm good$<misc_bad outro>
'Cause I'm miserable$<misc_bad outro>
And nobody even knows!$<misc_bad outro>
Try and come for my job$<misc_bad outro>
