THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT
Down Bad
[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then send me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
Fuck it if I can't have him
I might just die, it would make no difference
Down bad, waking up in blood
Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad, fuck it if I can't have him$<misc_bad post-chorus>
Down bad, fuck it if I can't have him$<misc_bad post-chorus>

[Verse 2]
Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about the existence of you

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I was heavenstruck

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
Fuck it if I can't have him
I might just die, it would make no difference
Down bad, waking up in blood
Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad, fuck it if I can't have him$<misc_bad post-chorus>
Down bad, fuck it if I can't have him$<misc_bad post-chorus>

[Bridge]
I loved your hostile take-overs
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's-?
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded?
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
Fuck it if I can't have him
I might just die, it would make no difference
Down bad, waking up in blood
Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad, fuck it if I can't have him$<misc_bad post-chorus>
Down bad, fuck it if I can't have him$<misc_bad post-chorus>

[Outro]
Like I lost my twin,
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
