THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT
Robin
[Verse 1]
Long may you reign
You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
Out window panes talking utter nonsense
You have no idea$<misc_bad end of verse>

[Pre-Chorus]
Strings tied to levers
Slowed-down clocks tethered
All this showmanship
To keep it for you in sweetness

[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you$<misc_bad end of chorus>

[Verse 2]
Long may you roar
At your dinosaurs
You're a just ruler
Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
And you have no idea$<misc_bad end of verse>

[Pre-Chorus]
Buried down deep and out of your reach
The secret we all vowed
To keep it from you in sweetness

[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you$<misc_bad end of chorus>

[Bridge]
You got the dragonflies above your bed
You have a favorite spot on the swing set
You have no room in your dreams for regrets$<misc_bad end of phrase>
(You have no idea)$<misc_bad end of phrase>
The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean
You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline
But now we'll curtail your curiosity
In sweetness$<misc_bad end of phrase>

[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you$<misc_bad end of chorus>
