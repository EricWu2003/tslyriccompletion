THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT
How Did It End?

[Verse 1]
We hereby conduct this post-mortem
He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
Our maladies were such we could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign

[Chorus]
Come one come all, it's happening again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no-one except all of our friends
We must know, how did it end?$<misc_bad end of chorus>

[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learn the right steps to different dances
And fell victim to interlopers' glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
Soon they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins

[Chorus]
Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear they called it all off
One gasp and then, how did it end?$<misc_bad end of chorus>

[Bridge]
Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me bereft and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree
D-Y-I-N-G$<misc_bad end of bridge>

[Pre-Chorus]
It's happening again$<misc_bad confusable>
How did it end?$<misc_bad confusable>
I can't pretend like I understand
How did it end?$<misc_bad confusable>

[Chorus]
Come one come all it's happening again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no-one except all of our friends
But I still don't know, how did it end?
