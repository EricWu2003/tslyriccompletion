Taylor Swift
Invisible
[Verse 1]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
[Chorus]
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible$<misc_bad end of chorus>
Oh, yeah$<exclamatory>
[Verse 2]
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
[Chorus]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Bridge]
Like shadows in a faded light, oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes and make you realize
[Chorus]
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you, let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible$<misc_bad end of chorus>
Oh, yeah$<exclamatory>
[Outro]
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
