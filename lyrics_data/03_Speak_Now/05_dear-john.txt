Speak Now
Dear John
[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again
My mother accused me of losing my mind but I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known$<misc_bad too short>
[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said "Run as fast as you can"
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I should've known$<misc_bad too short>
[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh$<exclamatory>
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known$<misc_bad too short>
You should've known$<misc_bad too short>
[Outro]
Don't you think I was too young?$<misc_bad in outro>
You should've known$<misc_bad too short>
