Speak Now
Electric Touch
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hanging out with you tonight
I've got my money on things going badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feeling your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
[Verse 2: Patrick Stump, Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]
I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm trying hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart
I've gotten used to no one calling my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleeping alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feeling your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Patrick Stump]
I was thinking just one time, maybe the stars align
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space or string me along while you decide
And just one time, maybe the moment's right
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights
[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift, Patrick Stump]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feeling your electric touch$<misc_bad can be confused with other lines>
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feeling your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
