august
[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you
[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Bridge]
Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no
[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine$<misc_bad end of chorus>
'Cause you were never mine, never mine$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Outro]
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"$<misc_bad confusable with the line in the bridge>
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"$<misc_bad confusable with the line in the bridge>
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all$<misc_bad end of song>
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all$<misc_bad end of song>
