Wildest Dreams
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha$<exclamatory>
Wildest dreams, ah, ha$<exclamatory>
[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha$<exclamatory>
Wildest dreams, ah, ha$<exclamatory>
[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
(Follow you around)$<misc_bad end of bridge>
[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha$<exclamatory>
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha$<misc_bad outro>
Even if it's just in your$<misc_bad outro>
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha$<misc_bad outro>
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha$<misc_bad outro>
