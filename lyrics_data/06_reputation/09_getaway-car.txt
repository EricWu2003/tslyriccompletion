Getaway Car
[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason
[Pre-Chorus]
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark
[Chorus]
You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
While he was running after us, I was screaming, "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry
[Pre-Chorus]
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart
[Chorus]
You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me
[Chorus]
Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Outro]
I was riding in a getaway car$<misc_bad confusable with others>
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
