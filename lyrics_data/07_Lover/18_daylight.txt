Lover
Daylight
[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye
[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now
[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight
[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
[Outro]
Like daylight$<misc_bad outro>
It's golden like daylight$<misc_bad outro>
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go$<misc_bad outro>
Just let it go, let it go$<misc_bad outro>
[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love$<misc_bad outro>
Not the things I hate$<misc_bad outro>
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of$<misc_bad outro>
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night$<misc_bad outro>
I, I just think that$<misc_bad outro>
You are what you love$<misc_bad outro>
