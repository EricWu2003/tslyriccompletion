We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, I love you
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh$<exclamatory>
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh$<exclamatory>
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
Like, ever$<exclamatory>
[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh$<exclamatory>
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh$<exclamatory>
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)$<exclamatory>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)$<exclamatory>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)$<exclamatory>
Oh-oh-oh$<exclamatory>
[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, "I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"
[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Outro]
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)$<misc_bad outro>
Getting back together$<misc_bad outro>
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)$<misc_bad outro>
Getting back together (Yeah)$<misc_bad outro>
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me$<misc_bad outro>

Getting back together$<misc_bad outro>
