Red
Message In A Bottle
[Verse 1]
I know that you like me
And it's kind of frightening standing here waiting, waiting
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied
[Pre-Chorus]
But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified
[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Verse 2]
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified
[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Bridge]
How is it in London?
Where were you while I'm wondering
If I'll ever see you again?
You could be the one that I love$<misc_bad different line>
And now I'm standing here, hoping it gets to you$<misc_bad end of bridge>
[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (You can't sleep at night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Outro]
You could be the one that I love$<misc_bad outro>
You could be the one that I love, I love$<misc_bad outro>
And now I'm standing, here hoping this gets to you$<misc_bad outro>
