I Knew You Were Trouble
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh$<exclamatory>
Trouble, trouble, trouble$<exclamatory>
Oh, oh-oh$<exclamatory>
Trouble, trouble, trouble$<exclamatory>
[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey
[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)$<exclamatory>
Trouble, trouble, trouble$<exclamatory>
Oh, oh-oh$<exclamatory>
Trouble, trouble, trouble$<exclamatory>
[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh$<exclamatory>
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)$<exclamatory>
Oh, oh-oh$<exclamatory>
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)$<exclamatory>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble$<exclamatory>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble$<exclamatory>
