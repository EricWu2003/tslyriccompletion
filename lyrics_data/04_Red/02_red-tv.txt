Red
Red
[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
But loving him was red$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
[Verse 2]
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
Oh, red (Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
Burning red (Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red$<misc_bad end of bridge>
[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
Yeah, yeah, red$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
Burning red (Red, red, red; red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)$<misc_bad exclamatory section>
[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head 
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah$<exclamatory>
[Outro]
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
