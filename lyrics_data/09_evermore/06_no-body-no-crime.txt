evermore
no body no crime
[Intro: HAIM]
He did it$<misc_bad too short>
He did it$<misc_bad too short>
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losing sleep
Her husband's acting different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no$<exclamatory>
I think he did it
No, no$<exclamatory>
He did it$<misc_bad too short>
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Garden
At her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime$<exclamatory>
But I ain't letting up until the day I die$<misc_bad end of chorus>
[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
No, no$<exclamatory>
I think he did it
No, no$<exclamatory>
He did it$<misc_bad too short>
[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it
[Outro: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he-
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he-
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he died
