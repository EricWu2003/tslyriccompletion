Midnights
Lavender Haze
[Intro]
Meet me at midnight
[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into my melancholia
[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny
You handled it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal$<misc_bad too short>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal$<misc_bad too short>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
[Verse 2]
All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kind of girl they see
Is a one-night or a wife
[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying
They're bringing up my history
But you weren't even listening
[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal$<misc_bad too short>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal$<misc_bad too short>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
[Post-Chorus]
That lavender haze$<misc_bad confusable with other parts of the song>
[Bridge]
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal$<misc_bad too short>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal$<misc_bad too short>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
[Outro]
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
The lavender haze, I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
