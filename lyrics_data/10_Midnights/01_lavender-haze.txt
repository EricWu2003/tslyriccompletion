Midnights
Lavender Haze
[Intro]
Meet me at midnight
[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia$<exclamatory>
[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)$<exclamatory>
You handled it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal$<exclamatory>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal$<exclamatory>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
[Verse 2]
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kind of girl they see (Only kind of girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife
[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)$<exclamatory>
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal$<exclamatory>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal$<exclamatory>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
[Post-Chorus]
That lavender haze
[Bridge]
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk (Get it off my desk)
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
[Chorus]
I feel (I feel), the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal$<exclamatory>
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal (No deal)$<exclamatory>
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
[Outro]
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
The lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
